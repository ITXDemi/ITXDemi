I'm currently specializing in Python, with other experience in:

  - HTML
  - Bash (unimpressive, but it's experience nonetheless)
  - Javascript
  - CSS (which i've totally forgotten)


I hope to get a degree in either networking or cybersecurity by the end of my college.

Hobbies:

 - Gaming
 - Programming 
 - Video editing
 - Working IT
 - Making music
 - Light comedy. See https://horribletoilet.github.io/ for an example.

I love opossums and raccoons :)
